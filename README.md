# Week-5-Excel-Project
Who knew pizza data could say so much? Cleaned, sliced, and served insights using Excel—think trends, timing, toppings, and a whole lot of learning. A fun mix of curiosity, charts, and creativity, all baked into one interactive dashboard.

In this project, I turned raw pizza sales data into a clean, interactive dashboard that reveals powerful insights.

Using over 48,000 rows of data, I explored real business questions like:

➡️ When do people love to order pizza?

➡️ Which pizza sizes and types bring in the most money?

➡️ Are customers price-sensitive?

➡️ What ingredients are most frequently used?

With the help of PivotTables, Power Query, Slicers, and dynamic charts, I transformed messy data into easy-to-understand visuals. I grouped orders by value, analyzed trends, and uncovered patterns in customer behavior.

But this project wasn’t just technical—it was personal. I worked on three different versions, faced setbacks, and kept going. Like Thomas Edison, every failed try brought me closer to success. It was a true lesson in resilience, creativity, and patience.
